When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Using remote repositories allows me to work from different computers and places.
    It also allows multiple people to work on same project. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Remote repository could be used by multiple people working on same project.
    What would happen if some of these persons make changes in the same file
    and function you are working on right now? You doubtly want to have your
    code be constantly changing while you are working. That could lead to some
    strange conflicts. So it's preferable to pull manualy when your repository
    is in logicaly ready state.

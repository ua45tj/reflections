When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Using remote repositories allows me to work from different computers and places.
    It also allows multiple people to work on same project. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Remote repository could be used by multiple people working on same project.
    What would happen if some of these persons make changes in the same file
    and function you are working on right now? You doubtly want to have your
    code be constantly changing while you are working. That could lead to some
    strange conflicts. So it's preferable to pull manualy when your repository
    is in logicaly ready state.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branch is just fancy name to some commit. Each commit has its parent or
    several parents. So to have quick access to some commits we use branches.
    Clone is full-copy of repository. Clones could be as local (inside your
    own filesystem) as remote (e.g. when you are cloning from github).
    Fork is kinda like clone from one account on github to other account on
    github. We can use forks if we want to make some changes without having
    permission to edit original remository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can cut off internet connection and hide into some bunker and code
    for 12 weeks not-stop. Your repository would have all history of changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

master?  What benefits does each approach have?

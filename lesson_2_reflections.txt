What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When git initializes repository it creates .git directory and inside this
directory git creates needed metadata files and makes some preparations.
We need to run git init to be able to use git on files under that directory.
Saying simple, we do 'git init' when we decide to use version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

It's different from working directory. When you want to make commit you should
place file into staging area first and then make commit to store that file
into repository. Staging area concept allows us to make changes to many files
but add only few of them to repository, also staging area concept offers
ability to have untracked files that we don't want to include into clean
repository (object files, some helpers, etc).

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit
per logical change?

Add some files to staging area using 'git add'. Then use 'git diff --staged' to
ensure that change is logical. Then make commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

Branches can be used when you want to expreriment or make special branch for
stable release, and continue active development on master, but fix bugs on
stable branch.
